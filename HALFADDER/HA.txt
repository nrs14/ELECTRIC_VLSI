Half adder is the simplest of all adder circuits. Half adder is a combinational arithmetic circuit that adds two numbers and produces a sum bit (s) and carry bit (c) both as output. The addition of 2 bits is done using a combination circuit called a Half adder. The input variables are augend and addend bits and output variables are sum & carry bits. A and B are the two input bits.
